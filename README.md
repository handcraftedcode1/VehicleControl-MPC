## Vehicle Control - Model Predictive Control Project
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)


In this project my goal is to be able to model the dynamics of a vehicle and implement a custom Model Predictive Control algorithm to optimally steer and control a vehicle. 

Check out the [writeup PDF](https://github.com/kylemartin1/VehicleControl-MPC/blob/master/CarNDMPCProjectWriteup.pdf) to learn how this algorithm works.
